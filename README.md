👋 Hi, I’m Eric Relleve 

🚀 Cloud • DevSecOps • AI Automation • Backend Engineering

I'm a systems thinker who enjoys connecting cloud infrastructure, security, automation, and AI to build real, scalable solutions.
My background in IT operations, workflow automation, compliance, and cloud engineering shapes how I design systems: secure, efficient, observable, and easy to maintain.

I’m currently building Tanggol-AI — an open, AI-powered legal information assistant for Filipinos — as my capstone project to demonstrate cloud, AI, security, and DevOps capabilities end-to-end.

👀 I’m interested in

Cloud Security (AWS + DevSecOps)

Kubernetes & Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform)

MLOps & AI Engineering (FastAPI, vector databases, Bedrock/OpenAI)

Intelligent automation (n8n, Make, Zapier)

Backend systems architecture

SOC-aligned log analysis & threat detection

Building AI assistants that solve real problems

🌱 I’m currently learning

FastAPI for backend microservices

Kubernetes fundamentals → CKA path

Terraform for scalable IaC

AWS SysOps / CloudOps

DevSecOps (IAM, KMS, GuardDuty, Secrets Manager)

AI microservices (RAG, embeddings, vector stores)

💼 What I do

Build automated workflows & AI agents

Develop REST APIs and backend services

Design secure cloud architectures (IAM, least privilege)

Deploy apps with CI/CD pipelines

Quantify system behavior using analytics and logging

Integrate cloud + automation + AI into real business ecosystems

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on

AI assistants (RAG systems, automation, knowledge tools)

Cloud security & DevSecOps projects

Kubernetes and infrastructure automation

Open-source API or backend projects
